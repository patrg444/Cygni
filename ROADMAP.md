# Cygni Platform Roadmap

## Current State (What's Actually Built) âœ…

### Core Platform

- **Full AWS Deployment Pipeline**: Git â†’ Build â†’ Deploy to ECS/Fargate
- **Production-Ready API**: 30+ endpoints with JWT auth, RBAC, audit logging
- **Enterprise Security**: SOC2 controls, fine-grained permissions, data encryption
- **Multi-Service Orchestration**: Deploy complex applications with dependencies
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deploys with instant rollback
- **Complete CLI**: 15+ commands with framework auto-detection
- **TypeScript SDK**: Full API coverage with React hooks
- **Real Infrastructure**: Terraform modules, Helm charts, multi-environment support

### What Makes Us Different

- First-class blue-green deployments (not just rolling updates)
- Multi-service orchestration without Kubernetes complexity
- Enterprise-ready from day one (RBAC, audit logs, SOC2)
- Developer-first CLI with framework auto-detection
- Real AWS resources, not abstractions

## 30-Day Sprint: Production Polish ðŸš€

### Week 1: Developer Experience

- [ ] **`cx doctor` Command** - Pre-flight checks for AWS, DNS, SSL, quotas
- [ ] **Cost Diff on Deploy** - Show price delta before confirmation
- [ ] **Deployment Progress TUI** - Rich terminal UI with progress bars

### Week 2: Observability

- [ ] **Deployment Timeline Dashboard** - Visual blue-green progress
- [ ] **Trace-to-Log Correlation** - Click trace â†’ see logs
- [ ] **Cost Dashboard** - Real-time AWS spend by service

### Week 3: Reliability

- [ ] **Automated Canary Deployments** - Progressive rollout with metrics
- [ ] **Self-Healing Containers** - Auto-restart on OOM/health failures
- [ ] **SLO Monitoring** - Track and alert on service objectives

### Week 4: Documentation

- [ ] **5-Minute Quick Start** - Git clone â†’ deploy in one sitting
- [ ] **Fargate â†’ EKS Migration Guide** - Zero-downtime path
- [ ] **Production Readiness Checklist** - Launch confidence

## 60-Day Goals: Market Differentiation ðŸŽ¯

### Advanced Deployments

- [ ] **Traffic Replay** - Test with production traffic patterns
- [ ] **Deployment Strategies** - Canary, blue-green, rolling, recreate
- [ ] **Multi-Region Support** - Deploy closer to users

### Enterprise Features

- [ ] **SSO/SAML Integration** - Enterprise authentication
- [ ] **Compliance Reports** - One-click SOC2/ISO evidence
- [ ] **Private Link Support** - Never touch public internet

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **GitHub App** - Auto-deploy on merge
- [ ] **PR Preview Environments** - Isolated per pull request
- [ ] **IDE Integrations** - VS Code extension

## 90-Day Vision: Platform Excellence ðŸŒŸ

### Scale & Performance

- [ ] **Global Edge Network** - CDN integration
- [ ] **Auto-Scaling Policies** - KEDA + custom metrics
- [ ] **Database Branching** - Dev/test with production data

### Ecosystem

- [ ] **Marketplace** - One-click addons (Redis, Postgres, etc.)
- [ ] **Templates Gallery** - Start from production examples
- [ ] **Partner Integrations** - Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty

### Innovation

- [ ] **AI-Powered Optimization** - Cost and performance recommendations
- [ ] **GitOps Mode** - Fully declarative deployments
- [ ] **Serverless Containers** - AWS App Runner integration

## Backlog (Future Considerations) ðŸ“‹

### Platform Expansion

- Google Cloud Run support
- Azure Container Instances
- Kubernetes native mode
- Edge computing (Lambda@Edge)

### Advanced Features

- Secrets rotation automation
- Disaster recovery automation
- Cross-region replication
- Data residency controls

### Developer Tools

- Local development proxy
- Production debugging tools
- Performance profiling
- Security scanning integration

## Success Metrics ðŸ“Š

### 30-Day Targets

- First deploy success rate > 95%
- Time to first deploy < 5 minutes
- Zero customer-reported security issues

### 60-Day Targets

- 100 active projects deployed
- 99.9% platform uptime
- < 2 minute support response time

### 90-Day Targets

- 1,000 deployments per day
- 50 enterprise customers
- $1M ARR

## How This Roadmap Differs

Unlike typical "build everything" roadmaps, this focuses on:

1. **Polish over features** - Make existing capabilities production-grade
2. **DX over complexity** - Every feature should make deployment easier
3. **Safety over speed** - Blue-green by default, rollback always works
4. **Transparency over magic** - Show costs, show progress, show impact

## Get Involved

- **Star the repo**: Show your support
- **Try it out**: `npx create-cygni-app`
- **Give feedback**: Open an issue
- **Contribute**: PRs welcome!
