# Phase 4: Preview Environments - Foundation Complete ✅

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the foundation for Vercel-like preview environments that automatically create isolated deployments for every pull request.

## What We Built

### 1. Git Integration (`cx git listen`)

- Webhook listener that receives GitHub events
- Supports webhook signature verification for security
- Handles pull request opened/closed/synchronized events
- Dry-run mode for testing without actual deployments

### 2. Namespace-Based Deployments

- Extended `cx deploy` with `--namespace` flag
- Each PR gets its own namespace (e.g., `preview-123`)
- Isolated deployment environment per namespace
- Unique URLs with namespace prefix: `https://preview-123-app.preview.cygni.dev`

### 3. Database Cloning (Simulated)

- TestApiServer creates isolated database copies for each namespace
- Production data is cloned (not shared) for realistic testing
- Each preview environment has its own data sandbox
- Automatic cleanup when namespace is deleted

### 4. Preview Environment Management

- `cx delete --namespace preview-123` to clean up manually
- Automatic cleanup when PR is closed
- Resource tracking per namespace:
  - Deployments
  - Databases
  - URLs
  - Services

### 5. GitHub Integration

- Automatic PR comments with preview URLs
- Status updates as deployment progresses
- Error reporting if deployment fails
- Clean, formatted comments with deployment details

## Architecture

```
GitHub PR Event → Webhook → cx git listen
                              ↓
                     Clone PR branch
                              ↓
                 cx deploy --namespace preview-{pr}
                              ↓
                 Create isolated namespace:
                 - Deploy services
                 - Clone database
                 - Generate URLs
                              ↓
                 Post comment to PR
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Webhook Handler

```bash
cx git listen --port 3333 --secret your-secret
```

- Receives GitHub webhook events
- Validates signatures for security
- Processes PR events asynchronously

### Namespace Deployment

```bash
cx deploy --namespace preview-123 --environment preview
```

- Creates isolated deployment space
- Generates namespace-specific URLs
- Tracks all resources in namespace

### Cleanup Command

```bash
cx delete --namespace preview-123 --force
```

- Removes all deployments in namespace
- Cleans up database copies
- Frees up resources

### TestApiServer Enhancements

- Namespace tracking and management
- Database cloning simulation
- Resource isolation per namespace
- URL generation with namespace prefixes

## Usage Example

1. **Start webhook listener:**

   ```bash
   cx git listen --port 3333
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub webhook:**
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
   - Events: Pull requests
   - Secret: Your webhook secret

3. **Set GitHub token for comments:**

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   ```

4. **When PR is opened:**
   - Webhook triggers deployment
   - Preview environment created
   - Comment posted to PR with URLs

5. **When PR is closed:**
   - Webhook triggers cleanup
   - All resources deleted
   - Namespace removed

## Next Steps for Phase 4

While the foundation is complete, these enhancements could be added:

1. **Real Database Cloning**
   - Implement actual database copy operations
   - Support different database types
   - Data anonymization options

2. **BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)**
   - Support for AWS/GCP/Azure deployments
   - Custom domain configuration
   - VPC/network isolation

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Environment variables per namespace
   - SSL certificates for preview domains
   - Resource limits and quotas
   - Deployment queuing

4. **Monitoring**
   - Preview environment health checks
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Automatic expiration policies

## Summary

The preview environments feature provides:

- ✅ Automatic deployments for every PR
- ✅ Isolated namespaces with unique URLs
- ✅ Database cloning (simulated)
- ✅ GitHub integration with PR comments
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on PR close
- ✅ Full CLI integration

This completes the foundation for preview environments, bringing Vercel-like functionality to the Cygni platform!
