# Quick Start

Get your first app deployed on Cygni in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- A GitHub account
- A Cygni account ([sign up free](https://app.cygni.dev/signup))

## Install the CLI

First, install the Cygni CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @cygni/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
cygni --version
```

## Login to Cygni

Authenticate with your Cygni account:

```bash
cygni login
```

This will open your browser for authentication. Once complete, you'll be logged in.

## Deploy Your First App

### Option 1: Deploy an Existing Project

Navigate to your project directory and deploy:

```bash
cd my-app
cygni deploy
```

Cygni will automatically:
- Detect your framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
- Build your application
- Deploy it globally
- Provide you with a live URL

### Option 2: Deploy a Template

Use one of our starter templates:

```bash
# Next.js app
cygni init my-app --template nextjs
cd my-app
cygni deploy

# Express API
cygni init my-api --template express
cd my-api
cygni deploy

# Static site
cygni init my-site --template static
cd my-site
cygni deploy
```

## Your App is Live! ðŸŽ‰

After deployment, you'll see output like:

```
âœ“ Build complete
âœ“ Deploying to Cygni...
âœ“ Deployment successful!

ðŸš€ Your app is live at: https://my-app-abc123.cygni.app
