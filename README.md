The full-stack developer cloud platform that combines the simplicity of PaaS with the flexibility of AWS. Deploy frontend, backend, databases, and workers - all in one place.

> **Current Status**: Cygni is in early alpha development. Core infrastructure is being built. Not yet ready for production use.

## Vision

Cygni aims to be the developer-first cloud platform that makes deploying full-stack applications as simple as `git push`, while giving you the power and flexibility of your own cloud infrastructure.

## Features (Planned)

- **One-Click Deployments**: Push to deploy with automatic CI/CD
- **Full-Stack Preview Environments**: Complete environments for every PR
- **Integrated Services**: Database, auth, storage, and background jobs built-in
- **Multi-Language Support**: Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, and more
- **Bring Your Own Cloud**: Deploy to your own AWS/GCP/Azure account
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and self-hostable

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules for AWS (VPC, RDS, EKS, S3)
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Production-ready Helm charts
- **API Service**: Core REST API with authentication and RBAC
- **CLI Tool**: Framework detection and deployment commands
- **SDK**: TypeScript/JavaScript SDK with full API coverage
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with health checks and security scanning
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds with security hardening

### In Progress

- Runtime orchestrator for container management
- Builder service for source-to-container
- Web dashboard UI
- Billing and metering integration

### Roadmap

- [ ] Complete runtime orchestrator with Kubernetes CRDs
- [ ] Implement builder service with buildpack support
- [ ] Create web dashboard for project management
- [ ] Add support for multiple cloud providers
- [ ] Implement preview environments
- [ ] Add monitoring and observability stack

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Go (for K8s controllers)
- **Tools**: pnpm workspaces, Turbo
