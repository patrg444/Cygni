- [ ] **Enterprise Features**
  - SSO (SAML)
  - Audit logs
  - SLA guarantees
  - VPC support

- [ ] **Platform Expansion**
  - More regions
  - More languages (Python, Go, Ruby)
  - Database provisioning
  - Background workers

- [ ] **Operational Excellence**
  - 99.9% uptime SLA
  - SOC2 compliance
  - 24/7 support
  - Status page

## Technical Debt Reality

### What the Demo Hides
1. **No State Management**: Everything is stateless
2. **No Queue System**: Builds would block
3. **No Database**: Can't track deployments
4. **No Auth**: Anyone could deploy
5. **No Isolation**: Shared AWS resources
6. **No Monitoring**: Blind to failures

### Minimum Infrastructure Needed
```yaml
Production:
  Database: RDS PostgreSQL ($100/mo)
  Cache: ElastiCache Redis ($50/mo)
  Queue: SQS + Lambda ($50/mo)
  Storage: S3 for logs/builds ($100/mo)
  Compute: ECS Fargate for services ($200/mo)
  CDN: CloudFront ($50/mo)
  Monitoring: Datadog ($200/mo)
  Total: ~$750/mo minimum
```

## Honest Timeline

**Month 1-2**: Foundation
- Set up real AWS infrastructure
- Build authentication system
- Create project/deployment models
- Basic API + database

**Month 3-4**: Core Features  
- Builder service with queuing
- Deployment orchestration
- Web dashboard MVP
- Billing integration

**Month 5-6**: Polish
- GitHub integration
- Monitoring/alerts
- Documentation
- Performance optimization

**Month 7-9**: Scale Prep
- Security audit
- Load testing
- Operational runbooks
- Enterprise features

## Competition Reality Check

**Vercel**: $2.5B valuation, 100+ engineers
**Render**: $4M ARR, 50+ engineers  
**Railway**: Recent $20M raise, 20+ engineers
**Fly.io**: $70M raised, 30+ engineers

**Cygni**: Demo + vision

## The Path Forward

1. **Demo wins funding** (not customers)
2. **MVP wins pilot customers** (10-20)
3. **Polish wins early adopters** (100-500)
4. **Scale wins market share** (1000+)

Current position: Step 0 of 4.

The demo is compelling, but building a production platform is a marathon, not a sprint.
